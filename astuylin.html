           Stuyvesant High School offers one of the country's most innovative and exciting computer science programs. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Courses in the sequence start with the assumption that students have never been exposed to computer science. Students completing the sequence will be exposed to advanced college level subjects.
        </p>
        <p> 
The program emphasizes a variety of problem solving techniques and exposes students to new and different ways of thinking. There is also an emphasis on the relationships between computer science and other subject areas.
